This repository contains an example template for a Docker application.
It is used to demonstrate the power of oh-my-vagrant!

Here are some useful commands.

docker images	# see what images exist
docker ps	# see what's running
docker run simple-app1	# run the container interactively
cid=$(docker ps | grep simple-app1 | awk '{print $1}' | head -1)	# id
cip=$(docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' $cid)
wget -q $cip:8000/README -O -	# read output from file

Happy hacking!
